Victims of Forced Migration,"This category includes persons that entered the US as refugees between 1987 and 2017. CMS derived the number of US residents who entered the country as refugees from 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) data as follows: (1) For each year from 1987 to 2017, DHS statistics were compiled for every country for (a) refugee arrivals, and (b) newly arriving lawful permanent residents (LPRs); (2) in each cell of the resulting matrix, the percentage of refugees to total arrivals was computed; (3) 2018 ACS data were compiled by country of origin and year of entry; and (4) in each cell of the matrix, the number residing in the United States in 2018 was multiplied by the percentage from (2), but only for those cells that had percentages of two-thirds or higher.  "
